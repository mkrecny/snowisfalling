# Synopsis

### A code puzzle involving snow, cellular automata and you 

# Why?

 - This project could be improved and expanded in a number of ways:
 -- Rendering performance 
 -- User Interface
 -- Make a more interesting backstory for the puzzle
 -- Make the puzzle more challenging

# Exploring cellular automata

 - This could also be the bare bones for a project that collaboratively explores 
   the space of 2D cellular automata. I have in mind a searchable database of CAs 
	 classified by their properties as interpreted by real people.
