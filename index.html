    ------------------------------------------------
      I can't tell you who we are, but I'd like to give you a few pointers.

      > Solutions to this problem should be emailed to:
        snow.code.puzzle [at] gmail [dot] com
        
      > You can communicate with us on twitter @snowcoder

      > There are 2 acceptable outcomes to this problem.
        1. (harder) Make the snow behave in a complex way (maybe a snowman will self-assemble!)
        2. (easier) Make the snow fall in a downwards direction
        

      > A solution might come in one of the following forms:
          1. An edited or new law.js 
          2. A edited or new automata.js
          3. A piece of text containing your thoughts on how to approach this problem.
          4. 1 & 2 & 3
          5. Something else entirely.

      > Don't be afraid to think outside of the automata :-)

      Good luck.
